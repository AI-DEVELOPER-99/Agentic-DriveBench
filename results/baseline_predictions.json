There is a truck visible on the left side of the image, and a car in front of the building. The sky appears to be overcast, suggesting it might be a cloudy day. The building has a large, dark facade with a metal roof, and there are no people or vehicles moving around at the moment. The scene is static, indicating that it may not be an active time for operations or loading/unloading activities.",

When approaching this location, the ego vehicle should first notice the building, which appears to be an industrial warehouse or factory. Upon reaching the location, the ego vehicle should park in a designated parking space if available and ensure that it is not obstructing any loading/unloading operations.\n\nThe second object the ego vehicle should notice is the truck parked in front of the building. The ego vehicle should be cautious when maneuvering around the truck to avoid any potential obstructions or hazards, such as loading/unloading activities or other vehicles entering/exiting the area.\n\nFinally, the third object the ego vehicle should notice is the parking lot with multiple trucks and a car. The ego vehicle should be aware of the presence of these vehicles and ensure that it parks in a safe and legal manner without obstructing any ongoing operations or causing congestion in the parking lot.",

    "pred": "The image shows a large industrial building with a truck parked in front of it. Based on the image, there is no visible action being taken by the ego vehicle at the moment. However, if we consider the context of an autonomous driving assistant, the ego vehicle could potentially be programmed to perform actions such as:\n\n1. If the goal is to deliver goods or pick up cargo from this location, it might need to approach the building and park in a designated loading area or wait for instructions to load/unload cargo. The probability of this action depends on whether the vehicle has been instructed to make a delivery or pickup at this location.\n2. If the goal is to navigate through the parking lot, the ego vehicle could move along the road and follow any traffic rules and signs to safely maneuver around the area. The probability of this action would depend on the current route planning and navigation instructions provided by the autonomous driving system.\n3. If the goal is to leave the area, the ego vehicle might need to reverse out of the parking space or drive away from the building if it's parked in a loading/unloading zone. The probability of this action would depend on whether the vehicle has completed its task and received instructions to leave the location.\n\nThe image does not provide enough information to determine the exact action that the ego vehicle should take, as it depends on the specific context and programming of the autonomous driving system.",
