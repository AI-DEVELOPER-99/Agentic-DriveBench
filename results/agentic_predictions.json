Second object**  \n- **What:** Vehicle in the adjacent lane that could merge into the ego lane (e.g., a truck on the right).  \n- **State:** Large, likely slower, may block the lane.  \n- **Action:** Keep a safe distance; if it blocks the lane, consider a safe lane change to the left or slow down to avoid collision.\n\n**3.
